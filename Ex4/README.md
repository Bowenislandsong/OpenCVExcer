Exercise 4:

1. Different Threshold values result in different effects. The "Bitterness" is based on different input and the expected result.

2. Binary thresholding is only showing 2 colors and will not show details of the picture. The filter is solely based on intensity of the pixel value. 

3. The adaptive filter shows more tolerance in deciding threshold values. The designed of such threshold value has more tolerance on the input.
